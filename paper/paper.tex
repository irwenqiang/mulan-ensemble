\section{Introduction}
What did we set out to do, i.e. what problem are we solving (can talk about
dataset or about the text categorization in general) and why are we trying to do
what we are trying to do (ensemble techniques look good). Estimated 1/2 of a
page, possibly more.

\section{Previous Work}
Some summary of results of ensemble techniques and possibly papers of other
people working on the same dataset as us. Estimated 1/2 of a page.
