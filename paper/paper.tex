\begin{abstract}
Text classification is one of the important problems being solved in
information retrieval. However, traditional single-label classifiers
are no longer sufficient and multi-label approaches are becoming more
relevant. There have been a lot of proposals for multi-label learners
and in our work, we tried applying ensemble techniques, which have
proven to be effective in solving other multi-label classification
problems, to combine them. We implemented seven ensemble techniques
presented in previous work and evaluated their performance. We have
found that some of the ensemble classifiers outperform all of the
individual classifiers. Ensemble techniques have thus proven
themselves to be applicable to the domain of text classification.
